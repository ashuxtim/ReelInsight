Here is the comprehensive ReelInsight Master Checklist, merging your requested features (Chapters, Hallucinations, Fine-Tuning) with the existing roadmap.

🚀 The Unified ReelInsight Master Checklist
⭐ PHASE 1 — Core ML & Search Quality
Goal: Make the search engine smarter and more relevant.

[ ] 1.3 Hard Negative Mining: Develop a method to create synthetic negative pairs to refine similarity thresholds and reduce false positives.

[ ] 1.4 Fine-Tuning (PEFT/LoRA): Implement Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (LoRA) for the CLIP model to better understand domain-specific queries.

[ ] 1.5 Hallucination Fix (Grounding): Enforce strict "Fact-Checking Mode" (Temperature 0) in the LLM engine to prevent invented answers.

⭐ PHASE 2 — ML Evaluation Suite
Goal: Measure and prove the system's accuracy.

[ ] 2.1 Metrics Dashboard: Create scripts to calculate industry-standard metrics like Precision@K, Recall@K, and mAP.

[ ] 2.2 Report Generation: Automatically generate HTML/Markdown reports summarizing retrieval performance.

⭐ PHASE 3 — UX & Product Features
Goal: Provide a polished, commercial-grade user experience.

[ ] 3.5 Batch Video Ingestion: (NEXT PRIORITY) Build a UI for uploading multiple files or folders at once with a status queue.

[ ] 3.1 Video Timeline Highlights: Visualize search matches as "ticks" on the video player's timeline bar.

[ ] 3.3 Advanced Search Filters: Add UI toggles for "Visual Only", "Audio Only", confidence thresholds, and time ranges.

[ ] 3.4 Multi-Query Mode: Support complex queries like "Find X AND Y" or "Find X NOT Y".

[ ] 3.6 Auto-Chapters UI: Connect the backend chapter generation logic to a frontend list that allows clicking to jump to specific topics.

⭐ PHASE 4 — Enterprise Features
Goal: Add robustness, user management, and data persistence.

[ ] 4.1 Production Database: Migrate metadata (logs, user history, project data) from JSON/Chroma to a robust SQL database (SQLite/PostgreSQL).

[ ] 4.2 User Access Control: Implement a basic login system with roles (Admin vs. Viewer).

⭐ PHASE 5 — Speed & Reliability
Goal: Optimize performance and stability.

[ ] 5.3 Embedding Cache: Implement a caching mechanism to avoid re-calculating embeddings for files that haven't changed.

[ ] 5.4 Incremental Indexing: Allow adding new segments to a video index without rebuilding the entire library.

[ ] 5.5 Error Handling & Retry Logic: Add robust error catching and automatic retries for failed processing tasks.

⭐ PHASE 6 — Deployment
Goal: Package and ship the application.

[ ] 6.2 Electron Desktop App: Wrap the React frontend into a standalone desktop application (.exe / .dmg).

[ ] 6.4 Docker Container: Create a Dockerfile to containerize the entire stack (Backend, Frontend, Database) for one-command deployment.

[ ] 6.5 Deployment Scripts: Create scripts for deploying to platforms like Render, Railway, or AWS.

This list covers everything we have discussed. We will start tackling Phase 3.5 (Batch Ingestion) tomorrow!
